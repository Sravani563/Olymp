\item Let ABC be a triangle and D be the mid-point of BC. Suppose the angle bisector of $\angle$ADC is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle ABD at D. Prove that $\angle$A = $90^{o}$.

\item Let ABC be a right-angle triangle with $\angle$B = $90^{o}$. Let I be the incentre of ABC. Extend AI and CI;let them intersect BC in D and AB in E respectively. Draw a line perpendicular to AI at I to meet AC in J; draw a line perpendicular to CI at I to meet AC in K. Suppose DJ = EK. Prove that BA = BC.

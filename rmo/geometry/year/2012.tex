\item Let ABC be a triangle and D be a point on the segment BC such that DC = 2BD. Let E be the mid-point of AC. Let AD and BE intersect in P. Determine the ratios BP/PE and AP/PD.

\item Let ABC be a triangle. Let BE and CF be internal angle bisector of $\angle$B and $\angle$C respectively with E on AC and F on AB. Suppose X is a point on the segment CF such that AX $\perp$ CF;and Y is a point on the segment BE such that AY $\perp$ BE. Prove that XY = (b + c - a)/2 where BC = a, CA = b and AB = c.

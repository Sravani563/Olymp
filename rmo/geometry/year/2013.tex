\item Let ABC be an acute-angle triangle. The circle $\Gamma$ with BC as diameter intersects AB and AC again at P and Q,respectively. Determine $\angle$BAC given that the orthocentre of triangle APQ lies on $\Gamma$.

\item Let ABC be a triangle with $\angle$A = $90^{o}$ and AB = AC. Let D and E be points on the segement BC such that BD:DE:EC=3:5:4 Prove that $\angle$DAE = $45^{o}$.

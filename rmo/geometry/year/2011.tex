\item Let ABC be a triangle. Let D, E, F be points respectively on the segments BC, CA, AB such that AD, BE, CF concur at the point K. Suppose BD/DC = BF/FA and $\angle$ADB = $\angle$AFC. Prove that $\angle$ABE = $\angle$CAD.

\item Let ABC be a triangle and let B$B_1$, C$C_1$ be respectively the bisector of $\angle$B, $\angle$C with $B_1$ on AC and $C_1$ on AB. Let E, F be the feet of perpendiculars drawn from A onto  B$B_1$,C$C_1$ respectively. Suppose D is the point at which the incircle of ABC touches AB. Prove that AD = EF.

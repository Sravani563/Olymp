\item Let BE and CF be the altitude if an acute angle triangle ABC, with E on AC and F on AB. Let O be the point of intersection of BE and CF. Take any line KL through O with K on AB and L on AC. Suppose M and N are located on BE and CF respectively, such that KM is perpendicular to BE and LN is perpendicular to CF. Prove that FM is parllel to EN.

\item In a triangle ABC, D is point on BC such that AD is internal bisector of $\angle$A. Suppose $\angle$B = 2$\angle$C and CD = AB. Prove that $\angle$A = $72^{o}$.

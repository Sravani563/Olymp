\item Let ABC be a right-angled triangle with $\angle$B = $90^{o}$. Let I be the incentre of ABC. Let AI extended intersect BC at F. Draw a perpendicular to AI at I. Let it intersect AC at E. Prove that IE = IF.

\item Let ABC be right-angle triangle with $\angle$B = $90^{o}$. Let AD be the bisector of $\angle$a with D on BC. Let the circumcircle of triangle ACD intersect AB again in E; and let the circumcircle of triangle ABD intersect AC again in F. Let K be the reflection of E in the line BC. Prove that FK = BC.

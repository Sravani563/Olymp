\item Let ABCDEF be a convex hexagon in which the diagonals AD, BE, CF are concurrent at O. Suppose the area of triangle OAF is the geometric mean of those of OAB and OEF;and the area of triangle OBC is geometric mean those of OAB and OCD. Prove that the area of triangle OED is the geometric mean of those of OCD and OEF.

\item Let ABC be a triangle in which $\angle$A = $60^{o}$. Let BE and CF be the bisectors of the angles $\angle$B and 
$\angle$C with E on the AC and F on AB. Let M be the reflection of A on the line EF. Prove that M lies on BC.

\item Let ABC be a right-angled triangle with $\angle$b = $90^{o}$. Let I be the incentre of ABC. Draw a line  perpendicular to AI at I. Let it intersect the line CB at D. Prove that CI is perpendicular to AD prove that 
ID = $\sqrt{b(b - a)}$ where BC=a and CA=b.

\item Let ABC be a triangle with centroid G. Let the circumcircle of triangle AGB intersect the line BC in X different from B;and the ciecumcircle of triangle AGC intersect the line BC in Y different from C. Prove that G is the centroid of triangle AXY.

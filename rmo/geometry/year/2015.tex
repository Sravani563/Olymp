\item In a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, let the diagonals AC and BD intersect at X. Let the circumcircles of triangles AXD and BXD intersect again at Y. If X is the incentre of triangle ABY, Show that $\angle$CAD = $90^{o}$.

\item Let ABC be a right triangle with $\angle$ B = $90^{o}$. Let E and F be respectively the mid-point of AB and AC. Suppose the incentre I of triangle ABC lies on the circumcircle of triangle AEF. Find the ratio of BC/AB.

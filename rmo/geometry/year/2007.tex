\item Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle;AD be the bisector of $\angle$ BAC with D on BC;and BE be the altitude from B on AC. Show that $\angle$CED $>$ $45^{o}$.

\item A trapezium ABCD in which AB is parallel to CD, is inscribed in a circle with centre O. Suppose the diagonals AC and BD of the trapezium intersect at M,and OM = 2.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\angle$AMB is $60^{o}$, determine with proof,the difference between the length of the parallel sides.
\item If $\angle$AMD is $60^{o}$, find all the difference between the length of the parallel sides.
\end{enumerate}

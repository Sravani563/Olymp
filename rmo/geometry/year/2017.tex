\item Let AOB be a given angle less than $180^{o}$ and let P be an interior point of the angular region determined by 
$\angle$AOB. Show with proof, how to construct, using only ruler and compasses, a line segment CD passing through P such that C lies on the ray QA and D lies on the ray OB, and CP:PD=1:2.

\item Let $\Omega$ be the circle with chord AB which is not a diameter. Let $\Gamma_1$ be a circle on one side of AB such that it is tangent to AB at C and internally tangent to $\Omega$ at D. Likewise ,let $\Gamma_2$ be a circle on the other side of AB such that it is tangent to AB at E and internally tangent to $\Omega$ at F. Suppose the line DC intersect 
$\Omega$ at X $\neq$ D and the line FE intersects $\Omega$ at Y$\neq$F. Prove that XY is diameter of $\Omega$.

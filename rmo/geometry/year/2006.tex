\item Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle and let D, E, F be the feet of perpendiculars from A, B, C respectively to BC, CA, AB. Let the perpendicular from F to CB, CA, AD, BE meet them in P, Q, M, N respectively. Prove that P, Q, M, N are collinear.

\item Let ABCD be a quadrilateral in which AB is parallel to CD and perpendicular to AD : AB = 3CD; and the area of the quadrilateral is 4. If a circle can be drawn touching all the sides of the quadrilateral, find its radius.

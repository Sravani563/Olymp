\item Let ABC be the Isosceles triangle with AB = AC. Let $\Gamma$ be its circumcircle and let O be the center of $\Gamma$. Let CO meet $\Gamma$ in D. Draw line parllel to AC through D. Let it intresect AB at E. Suppose AE : EB = 2 : 1. Prove that ABC is an equilateral triangle.

\item Let a, b, c be positive real number such that
\begin{align*}
\frac{ac}{1+bc} + \frac{bc}{1+ca} + \frac{ca}{1+ab} = 1
\end{align*}
Prove that 
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{a^3} + \frac{1}{b^3} + \frac{1}{c^3} \geq 6\sqrt{2}
\end{align*}

\item Let ABC be a triangle, AD an altitude and AE a median. Assume B, D, E, C lie in that order on the line BC. Suppose the incentre of triangle ABE lies on AD and the incentre ADC lies on AE. Find, with proof, the angles of triangle ABC.

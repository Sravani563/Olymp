\item Consider in plane circle $\Gamma$ with center O and a line l not intersecting circle $\Gamma$. Prove that there is a unique point Q on the perpendicular drawn from O to the line l, such that for any point P on the line l, PQ represents the length of the tangent from P to the circle $\Gamma$.

\item Let ABCD be a quadrilateral X and Y be the mid points of AC and BD respectively and the lines through X and Y respectively parllel to BD, AC meet in O. Let P, Q, R, S be the mid points of AB, BC, CD, DA respectively. Prove that
\begin{enumerate}
\item quadrilaterals APOS and APXS have the same area.
\item the areeas is the quadrilateral APOS, BQOP, CROQ, DSOR are all equal. 
\end{enumerate}

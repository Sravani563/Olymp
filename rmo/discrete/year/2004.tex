\item Positive integers are written on all the faces of a cube, one on each. At each corner of the cube. The product of the number on the faces that meet at the corner is written. The sum of the numbers written at all the corners is 2004. If T denotes the sum of the number on all the faces, find all the possible values of T.

\item Prove that the number of triples (A, B, C) when A, B, C are subsets of $\{1,2,3,....n\}$ such that 
A $\cap$ B $\cap$ C = $\phi$,A $\cap$ B = $\phi$,\\B $\cap$ C $\neq$ 0 is $7^n - 2.6^n + 5^n$.

\item Let $\langle$ $p_1, p_2, p_3,...,p_n,..$ $\rangle$ be a squence of primes definite by $p_1$ = 2 and for n $\geq$ 1,$p_{n+1}$ is largest prime factor of $p_1, p_2, p_3,...,p_n+1$,(Thus $p_2=3$, $p_3=7$ ).Prove that $p_n \neq 5$ for any n.

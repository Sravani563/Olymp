\item Let a, b, c, d, e, f be positive integers such that 
\begin{align*}
\frac{a}{b} < \frac{c}{d} < \frac{e}{f}.
\end{align*}
Suppose af - be = -1. Show that d $\geq$ b + f.

\item There are 100 countries participating in an olympiad. Suppose n is a positive integer such that each of the countries is willing to communicate in exactly n languages. If each set of 20 countries can communicate in at least one common language,and no language is common to all 100 countries, what is the minimum possible value of n?

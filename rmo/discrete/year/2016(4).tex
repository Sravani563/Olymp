\item The present ages in years of two brothers A and B and their father C are three distinct positive integers a, b,and c respectively. Suppose $\frac{b-1}{a-1}$ and $\frac{b+1}{a+1}$ are two consecutive integers, and $\frac{c-1}{b-1}$ and 
$\frac{c+1}{b+1}$ are two consecutive integers. If a + b + c $\leq$ 150 determine a, b and c.

\item A box contain 4032 answer scripts out of which exactly half have odd numbers of marks. We chose 2 scripts randomly and,if the score on both of them are odd number, we add one mark to one of them, put the scrip back in the box and keep the other scrip outside. If both scrips have even score, we put back the one of the scripts and keep other outside. If there is one script with even and other with odd score, we put back the script with the odd score and keep the other script outside. After following this procedure a number of times, there are 3 scripts left among which there is at least one script each with odd and even scores. Find,with proof,the number of scripts with odd score among the three left.

\item 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that if an infinite sequence of strictly increasing positive integers in arithmetic progression has one cube then it has infinitely many cubes.
\item Find, with justification, an infinite sequence of strictly increasing positive integers in arithmetic progression which does not have any cube.
\end{enumerate}

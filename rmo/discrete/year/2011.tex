\item Let ($a_1, a_2, a_3,...a_{2011}$) be a permutation of the numbers 1, 2, 3,....2011. Show that there exist two numbers j, k such that 1 $\leq$ j $<$ k $\leq$ 2011 and $|a_j-j|$ = $|a_k-k|$.

\item A natural number n is chosen strictly between two consecutive perfect squares. The smaller of these two squares is obtained by subtracting k from n and the larger one is obtained by adding l to n. Prove that n-kl is a perfect square.

\item Consider a 20-sided convex polygon K, with vertices $A_1, A_2, A_3....,A_{20}$ in that order. Find the number of ways in which three sides of K can be chosen so that every pair among them has at least two sides of K between them.

\item Let ABC be an acute angled triangle; let D, F be the mid-point of BC, AB respectively. Let the perpendicular from F to AC and the perpendicular at B to BC meet in N. Prove that ND is equal to the circum radius of ABC.

\item Find number of all 6-digit natural numbers such that the sum of their digits is 10 and each of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3 occurs at least once in them.

\item There nonzero real numbers a, b and c are said to be harmonic progression if 
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{c} = \frac{2}{b}
\end{align*}
find all three-term harmonic progression a, b, c strictly increasing positive integers in which a = 20 and b divides c.

\item Find the number of all integer-sides isosceles obtuse-angled triangles with perimeter 2008.

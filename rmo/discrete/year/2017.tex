\item Consider $n^{2}$ units squares in the xy-plane centred at point (i, j) with integer co-ordinates, 
1 $\leq$ i $\leq$ n, 1 $\leq$ j $\leq$ n. It is required to colour each unit square in such a way that when ever 
1 $\leq$ i $<$ j $\leq$ n and 1 $\leq$ k $<$ l $\leq$ n,the three squares with centres at (i, k),(j, k),(j, l)have distinct colours. What is the least possible number of colours needed?

\item Let x, y, z be real numbers each greater than 1. Prove that 
\begin{align*}
\frac{x+1}{y+1} + \frac{y+1}{z+1} + \frac{z+1}{x+1} \leq \frac{y-1}{z-1} + \frac{z-1}{x-1}.
\end{align*}

\item For any natural number n, express in base 10, let S(n) denote the sum of all digits of n. Find all natural numbers n such that $n^{3}$ = $8S(n)^{3} + 6nS(n) + 1$.

\item How many 6-digit natural numbers containing only the digits 1, 2, 3 are there in which 3 occur exactly twice and the number is divisible by 9?

\item Show that the infinite arithmetic progression $\{1, 4, 7, 10,..\}$ has infinitely many 3-term sub sequence in harmonic progression such that for any two such triples $\{a_1, a_2, a_3\}$ and $\{b_1, b_2, b_3\}$ in harmonic progression,one has
\begin{align*}
\frac{a_1}{b_1} \neq \frac{a_2}{b_2}
\end{align*}

\item Find the number of 4-digit numbers  having non-zero digits and which are divisible by 4 but not 8.

\item Find three distinct positive integers with the least possible sum such that the sum of the
reciprocals of any two integers among them is an integral multiple of the reciprocal of the third integer.

\item For each integer n $\geq$ 1, define $a_n$=[$\frac{n}{\sqrt{n}}$], where [x] denotes the largest integer not exceeding x,for any real number x. Find the number of all n in the set $\{1,2,3,....2010\}$ for which $a_n > a_{n+1}$

\item Let 
\begin{align*}
P_1(x) = ax^2 - bx - c,
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
P_2(x) = bx^2 - cx - a,
\end{align*}
\begin{align*} 
P_3(x) = cx^2 - ax - b
\end{align*}
be three quadratic polynomials where a, b, c are non-zero real numbers. Suppose there exists a real number 
$\alpha$ such that $P_(\alpha) = P_2(\alpha)= P_3(\alpha)$. Prove that a = b = c

\item Find the number of 4-digit numbers  having non-zero digits and which are divisible by 4 but not 8.

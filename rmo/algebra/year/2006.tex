\item If a, b, c are three real numbers such that $|a-b| \geq |c|$, $|b-c| \geq |a|$, $|c-a| \geq |b|$, then prove that one of a, b, c is the sum of the other two.

\item Determine all triples (a, b, c) of positive integers such that a $\leq$ b $\leq$ c and 
\begin{align*}
a + b + c + ab + bc + ac = abc + 1
\end{align*}

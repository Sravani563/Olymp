\item Let 
\begin{align*}
f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*} 
g(x) = x^3 + bx^2 + cx + a,
\end{align*}
where a, b, c are integers with c $\neq$ 0. Suppose that the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item f(1)=0;
\item the roots of g(x)=0 are the squares of the roots of f(x)=0
\end{enumerate}
Find the value of $a^{2013} + b^{2013} + c^{2013}$.

\item Supppose that m and n are integers such that both the quadratic equations
\begin{align} 
x^2 + mx - n = 0
\end{align}
and 
\begin{align}
x^2 - mx + n = 0
\end{align} 
have integer roots. Prove that n is divisible by 6.

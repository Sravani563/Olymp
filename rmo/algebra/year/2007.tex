\item Let a, b, c be the three natural numbers such that $a < b < c$ and ged(c-a, c-b) = 1. Suppose there exists an integer d such that a+d, b+d, c+d from the sides of a right angled triangle. Prove that there exist integers l, m such that 
c + d = $l^2 + m^2$.

\item Find all pairs (a, b) of real numbers such that whenever $\alpha$ is a root of
\begin{align} 
x^2 + ax + b = 0,
\end{align}
$\alpha^2$ - 2 is also a root of the equation.
